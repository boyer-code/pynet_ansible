I explained to you how to create a Git repository in GitHub and how to clone a Git repository from GitHub. I did not explain to you, however, how to create a new Git repository directly on a Linux system. You can do this as follows:

 

# Set your Git name and Git email address. These are included in commits.

# You only have to do this once per system

git config --global user.name "Kirk Byers"
git config --global user.email "ktbyers@twb-tech.com"

 

# Make your repository directory

mkdir pynet_testz

cd pynet_testz

 

# Initialize the repository

git init

 

# Add a file

touch README.md

git add README.md

git commit -m 'Initial commit'

 

# Add a git remote (pointing to GitHub)

# Only necessary if you are going to push changes up to GitHub

# You will still need to create the remote 'pynet_test' repository in GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/ktbyers/pynet_test.git

 

In my examples, I was generally showing a single 'git add' and then a corresponding commit. You can also add or modify a set of files to a single commit. This is a very common pattern (i.e. make a set of changes, 'git add' the files, make a commit).
